It will mostly work but that is only because the reservations are
mostly contiguous anyway because they are done early and
are small. The hardware requires contiguous buffers in all
three cases. I'm not sure I always got it right.

I don't know the exact semantics of using DRM_KMS_CMA*
without actually using DMA_CMA. I suspect small allocations
will be contiguous and big allocations will start to fragment?
but it's just my guess. I guess "really need it"?
