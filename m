We can't do this yet as the clk driver isn't yet merged, and it breaks from the
"just move the node" description in the commit message.

Did you intend to change the size cell value here? It now matches the g4, but
there was an explicit comment about the size for some reason in the -hunk
below. It's probably worth an explicit call-out if we're going to change it.

See the clk comment on the g4 diff.

Cheers,
