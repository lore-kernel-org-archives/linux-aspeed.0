Okay, I'll keep this property as it is then.

Aspeed IP has the BUSY bit on the I2CD14 register and we are already
using the bit in the current code for single-master use cases.
Due to the bit doesn't cover well multi-master use cases so we need to
improve the current busy checking logic using the 'Transfer Mode State
Machine' bit fields on the same register through this patch set.

Thanks for the review!
