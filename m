My personal take on this is that GENMASK() is really not useful, it's
just pure obfuscation and leads to exactly these kinds of mistakes.

Yes, I fully understand the argument that you can just specify the
start and end bits, and it _in theory_ makes the code more readable.

However, the problem is when writing code.  GENMASK(a, b).  Is a the
starting bit or ending bit?  Is b the number of bits?  It's confusing
and causes mistakes resulting in incorrect code.  A BUILD_BUG_ON()
can catch some of the cases, but not all of them.

For example:

	GENMASK(6, 2)

would satisify the requirement that a > b, so a BUILD_BUG_ON() will
not trigger, but was the author meaning 0x3c or 0xc0?

Personally, I've decided I am _not_ going to use GENMASK() in my code
because I struggle to get the macro arguments correct - I'm _much_
happier, and it is way more reliable for me to write the mask in hex
notation.

I think this is where use of a ternary operator would come in use.  The
normal way of writing a number of bits tends to be "a:b", so if GENMASK
took something like GENMASK(6:2), then I'd have less issue with it,
because it's argument is then in a familiar notation.

Yes, I'm sure that someone will point out that the GENMASK arguments
are just in the same order, but that doesn't prevent _me_ frequently
getting it wrong - and that's the point.  The macro seems to me to
cause more problems than it solves.
