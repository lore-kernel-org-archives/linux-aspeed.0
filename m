Subject: [RFC PATCH i2c-next 0/2] i2c: aspeed: Add bus idle waiting logic for
 multi-master use cases

In multi-master environment, this driver side master cannot know
exactly when peer master sends data to this side master so a case
can be happened that this master tries to send data through the
master_xfer function but slave data from peer master is still
being processed by this driver.

To prevent state corruption in the case, this patch adds checking
if any slave operation is ongoing and it wait up to the timeout
duration before starting a master_xfer operation.

Please review this patch set.

Thanks,

-Jae
