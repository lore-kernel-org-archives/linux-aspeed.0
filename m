Great find!

Can you please send these upstream as a fix? Apply to 4.17-rc2, and
use get_maintainers.pl to identify the lists to send it to.

Also add:

This numbers form the kernel ABI, so we shouldn't be changing them.
However, none of the mainline device trees use PCIVGA, so we can
rename that without breaking any one.

If we leave PWM as 5, and rename PCIVGA to PECI, we won't break any
existing device trees.

Cheers,

Joel
