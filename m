Hello,

These changes enable recently (and not-so-recently) upstreamed drivers
for the ASPEED BMC device trees.

Palmetto also has some updates that bring it close to being able to boot
a host with an upstream kernel.

I will merge them through the ASPEED tree once they have been reviewed.

Joel Stanley (6):
  ARM: dts: aspeed: Add IPMI BT node
  ARM: dts: aspeed: Enable IPMI BT node on OpenPower machines
  ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Update LPC node
  ARM: dts: aspeed: Add LPC clock phandles
  ARM: dts: palmetto: Add LEDs and GPIO keys
  ARM: dts: aspeed: Add Palmetto GPIO hogs
