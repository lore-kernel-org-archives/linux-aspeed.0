This patch series is add clk driver for AST2700.

AST2700 is the 8th generation of Integrated Remote Management Processor
introduced by ASPEED Technology Inc. Which is Board Management controller
(BMC) SoC family. AST2700 have two SoC connected, one is SoC0, another
is SoC1, it has it's own scu, this driver inlcude SCU0 and SCU1 driver.

v3:
-yaml: v2 missing send yaml patch, v3 add.
-yaml: drop 64bits address example.
-yaml: add discription about soc0 and soc1
-dt-bindings: remove (), *_NUMS, reserved.
-dt-bindings: remove dulipated define number.
-dt-bindings: merge clk and reset to be one patch.
-reset-aspeed: add auxiliary device for reset driver.
-clk-ast2700: modify reset to be auxiliary add.
-clk-ast2700: modify to be platform driver.
-clk-ast2700: modify each clk to const clk array.

v2:
-yaml: drop 64bits address example.
-yaml: add discription about soc0 and soc1
-dt-bindings: remove (), *_NUMS, reserved.
-dt-bindings: remove dulipated define number
-clk-ast2700: drop WARN_ON, weird comment.

Ryan Chen (4):
  dt-bindings: mfd: aspeed: support for AST2700
  dt-bindings: Add AST2700 bindings
  reset: aspeed: register AST2700 reset auxiliary bus device
  clk: aspeed: add AST2700 clock driver.
