This is a nice set of cleanups outside of just allowing raw access.
I'll let you handle Zev's comments and a few of mine.

I almost hate to ask this, but would there be value in allowing the BT
driver to use this abstract interface?  Or maybe it would be just too
hard to get a common abstraction, more work than it's worth.  It's
surprising that more people don't want BT as it's vastly superior to
KCS.  Just a thought for now.  I guess there's SMIC, but hopefully
nobody wants that.
