These are all separatge patches.

Please run scripts/checkpatch.pl and fix reported warnings. Some
warnings can be ignored, but the code here looks like it needs a fix.
Feel free to get in touch if the warning is not clear.

It does not look like you tested the bindings, at least after quick
look. Please run `make dt_binding_check` (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/writing-schema.rst for instructions).
Maybe you need to update your dtschema and yamllint.

Not reviewing further. Test your code....

Best regards,
Krzysztof
