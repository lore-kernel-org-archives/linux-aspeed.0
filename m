Hello ARM maintainers,

Here are the ASPEED devicetree updates for 4.16.

They've had a run through a few next trees where Stephen noticed two minor
merge conflicts[1] that should be obvious to resolve, but please let me know if
you have concerns.

[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/21/750

As discussed with Arnd, there is a commit for a clock header in
include/dt-bindings
that is also being merged through the clk tree. This should require no special
attention.

Thanks!

  ARM: dts: aspeed-evb: Add unit name to memory node (2017-12-21 14:03:22 +1030)

----------------------------------------------------------------
ASPEED device tree updates for 4.16

Clock driver support:

 Rework all platforms to use proper clock bindings. Linux should now boot
 upstream kernels on ast2400 and ast2500 platforms without out of tree
 patches.

New systems:

 Witherspoon: OpenPower Power9 server manufactured by IBM that uses
the ASPEED ast2500
 Zaius: OpenPower Power9 server manufactured by Invatech that uses the
ASPEED ast2500
 Q71L: Intel Xeon server manufactured by Qanta that uses the ASPEED ast2400

 We also see updates to the Palmetto and Romulus systems to bring them in
 line with the functionality of those above.

 The systems take advantage of recently added drivers for LPC Snoop
 device and the PWM/Tachometer fan controller.

OpenBMC flash layout:

 The flash layout used OpenBMC systems is added and the device trees now
 use it.
