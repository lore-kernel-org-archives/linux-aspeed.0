Firestone was never really maintained. We hacked around with it for a bit, but nothing concrete really came of it. As far as I'm aware, no-one is working on upstreaming it.

Also, I don't think there were any scripts used in the process, so it's going to be some drudge work to get things running.

Sorry that I don't have a more positive answer. Maybe someone else knows better.

Cheers,

Andrew
