Yeah.. And ideally this would be done in smaller steps as these will
conflict with all the other pending patches.

For example, I have a pile of pending omap clock clean-up dts patches
posted and tested waiting for v5.19-rc1 to apply. I'd rather not start
redoing or fixing up the patches with sed :)

What I'd like to have see is that at some point when suitable we move
one machine at a time with a script if possible.. Maybe the dtb files
generated would need to remain in the current directory until all of
the machine dts files are moved? That should help with the build
scripting too probably :)

In general I like the idea though and I think we should do it.

Regards,

Tony
