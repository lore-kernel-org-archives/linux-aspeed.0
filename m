Nope, clk_get_rate() is OK.
The reason I make this change is because the PWM supports two types of clock
source, the 24MHz or the clock from memory controller.
If the DT uses 24MHz clock, this code is OK.
But if the DT configs this pwm to use mclk (memory controller clk), this piece
of code becomes wrong, because the code
`aspeed_set_clock_source(priv->regmap, 0)` configs the device to use the 24MHz
clock.
So no matter what DT configs the clk, this driver *always* uses 24MHz clock.

That's why I want to make this change.

This driver currently supports ast2400 and ast2500, and they both use 24MHz
clock.
In case future device uses a different clock, we can update this code, right?

Sure, I will send patch to config the clock to use fixed 24MHz clock as well.
