This series of device tree patches for the ASPEED BMC machines
moves all systems to use the soon to be merged clk driver, and
updates machines to use all of the drivers we have upstream.

 v2: Address review from Arnd
  - Remove NUM_CLKS from dt header
  - Send VUART patch as a fix, drop it from this series
  - Add reasoning for breaking old kernel in the 'proper clock
    references' patch

In addition it adds three new OpenBMC systems that have been developed
in the OpenBMC kernel tree over the past year: two Power9 OpenPower
systems, and a port by Google to a Quanta x86 server.

I have boot tested these on Romulus and Palmetto, as well as boot tested
all device trees in Qemu.

Please review the boards you are familiar with. I will merge these in to
the ASPEED ARM SoC tree for inclusion in 4.16.
