The legacy driver of aspeed pwm is binding with tach controller and it
doesn't follow the pwm framworks usage. In addition, the pwm register
usage of the 6th generation of ast26xx has drastic change. So these
patch serials add the new aspeed pwm driver to fix up the problem above.

Changes since v3:
- Add the dt_binding for aspeed,ast2600-tach.
- Describe the pwm/tach as child-node of pwm-tach mfd.
- Complete the properties of pwm node.

Changes since v2:
- Remove the tach node, #address-cells and #size-cells from pwm-tach.yaml
- Add clocks and reset properties to pwm-tach.yaml
- Kconfig/Makfile sorted alphabetically
- pwm-aspeed-g6.c suggested by Uwe Kleine-K?nig
  - Add more hardware descriptions at top of the driver.
  - Remove unused api request and free
  - Move the initialize settings of all pwm channel to probe.
  - Change the method of getting the approximate period.
  - Read the hardware register values to fill the state for .get_state()

Changes since v1:
- Fix the dt_binding_check fail suggested by Rob Herring
- Add depends to PWM_ASPEED_G6 configure suggested by Uwe Kleine-Konig
- pwm-aspeed-g6.c suggested by Uwe Kleine-K?nig
  - Fix license header
  - Use bitfiled.h macro to define register fields
  - Implement .remove device function
  - Implement .get_state pwm api
