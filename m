Hello,

This series implements support for the MMC core clk-phase-* devicetree bindings
in the Aspeed SD/eMMC driver. The relevant register was exposed on the AST2600
and is present for both the SD/MMC controller and the dedicated eMMC
controller.

v5 fixes some build issues identified by the kernel test robot.

v4 can be found here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mmc/20201207142556.2045481-1-andrew at aj.id.au/

The series has had light testing on an AST2600-based platform which requires
180deg of input and output clock phase correction at HS200, as well as some
synthetic testing under qemu and KUnit.

Please review!

Cheers,

Andrew
