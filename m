Subject: [PATCH v4 0/5] Remove LPC register partitioning

The LPC controller has no concept of the BMC and the Host partitions.
The incorrect partitioning can impose unnecessary range restrictions
on register access through the syscon regmap interface.

For instance, HICRB contains the I/O port address configuration
of KCS channel 1/2. However, the KCS#1/#2 drivers cannot access
HICRB as it is located at the other LPC partition.

In addition, to be backward compatible, the newly added HW control
bits could be located at any reserved bits over the LPC addressing
space.

Thereby, this patch series aims to remove the LPC partitioning for
better driver development and maintenance. This requires the change
to both the device tree and the driver implementation. To ensure
both sides are synchronously updated, a v2 binding check is added.

Chagnes since v3:
	- Revise binding check as suggested by Haiyue Wang

Changes since v2:
	- Add v2 binding check to ensure the synchronization between the
	  device tree change and the driver register offset fix.

Changes since v1:
	- Add the fix to the aspeed-lpc binding documentation.
