I've used these a lot (and personally prefer the lower-case ones).

Your new macros don't do anything to ensure the field mask is
of the right form, which is basically:  (2 ^ width - 1) << shift

I really like the property that the field mask must be constant.

That being said, I've had to use some strange coding patterns
in order to adhere to the "const only" rule in a few cases.
So if you can come up with a satisfactory naming scheme I'm
all for it.
