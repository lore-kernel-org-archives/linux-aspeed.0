Hi,

I came across this patch as part of Joel's pull request, so this is
somewhat high latency review that I guess nobody else cared to do:

This is a red flag with respect to obscurity. It's a magic dtsi file
that has to be included at the right spot in the dts file or things
will break horribly -- we really try to avoid those kind of
constructs.

Also, you use it by passing in a predefined CHIP_ID, so you have
#define / #include / #undef. And on top of that you have open-coded
actual stable naming references to nodes that can't be found because
they're created by macros.

I know you want this to instantiate a bunch of boilerplate, so if you
want to do that, maybe you'd be better off having this file just
define a couple of macros, and then instantiate the actual subtrees
with that macro (the macro can then take the chipid). That way you can
still expose the same label-making macros in the locations where you
setup the stable naming. Much less cognitive load on someone trying to
read it and figure out just what's being instantiated where, and what
nodes the i2c<#> aliases are referring to.

This is... unconventional. Fixed mapping but up at a high bus range
such that it won't conflict with other SoC busses?

Just make your tools figure out what bus to use with sysfs or DT
entries instead, much less of a hack. We've done these things to IRQs
and GPIOs in the past, and it's a pain to clean up later.
