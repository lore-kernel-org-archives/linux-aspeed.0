No, that would lead to a NULL dereference.

The problem is the mis-use of iterator outside the loop on exit, and
the iterator will be the HEAD's container_of pointer which pointers
to a type-confused struct. Sidenote: The *mis-use* here refers to
mistakely access to other members of the struct, instead of the
list_head member which acutally is the valid HEAD.

IOW, you would dereference a (NULL + offset_of_member) address here.

Please remind me if i missed something, thanks.

The "list_for_each_entry_inside(pos, type, head, member)" way makes
the iterator invisiable outside the loop, and would be catched by
compiler if use-after-loop things happened.

Can you share your "alternative definitions" details? thanks!
