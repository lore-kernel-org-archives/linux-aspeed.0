Definately NACK on the #retries part. This is purely a configuration
thing. Besides that it is kind of ancient cruft, too. I don't recommend
it, at all.

On the timeout thing, I am still not fully convinced that this is a HW
description. I said that before. But maybe I need to understand your
problem case better.
