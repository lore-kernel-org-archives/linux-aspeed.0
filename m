On most architectures and configurations yes, but not on some of
the minor architectures if CONFIG_BUG is disabled.

Not sure, that might not work well in cases where it's a compile-time
constant in some configurations but variable in others.

Right.

Traditionally when CONFIG_BUG was disabled, we would have continued
here, so that could have been intentional, but in any case a WARN_ON()
would have been more appropriate here.
