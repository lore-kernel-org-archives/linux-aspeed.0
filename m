This aspect mustn't be underestimated and I anticipate lots of issues 
during a long time on this particular topic of "build systems".

Another aspect is CI and public or private testing farms we all have 
running.

These aspects always refrained me to change anything in the naming 
scheme of our DT files, but if we go in this direction, we must really 
be prepared and I'm still not convince it's worth it...


If this has to happen, I would also like to queue some file name changes 
to do all modifications in one go in order to lower the annoyance level 
of those who would need to adapt to those changes.

BTW, is there a common scheme for dts/dtsi file naming? Is it more 
enforced in one way or another for arm64 in a sense that I can take some 
norm as an example?

[..]

Best regards,
   Nicolas
