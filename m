I am not going to accept this change, period. This is not one, it is five steps
backward. If "aspeed_set_clock_source(priv->regmap, 0)" changes the clock speed,
or the clock source, read it later, and attach to the correct clock. If that
doesn't work, fix the problem in the clock subsystem. Hacking the driver is just
plain wrong.

Also, if the idea in DT is to provide a different clock to the watchdog on purpose,
maybe the call to "aspeed_set_clock_source(priv->regmap, 0)" is wrong.
