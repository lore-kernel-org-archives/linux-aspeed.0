Sure, some more background:

We did not notice this until we attempted to use the clock for the mtd
driver. However, this clock is used for the kernel clocksource, so eg.
sleep 1 takes two seconds to complete. This affects all of the systems
I have access to.

I suggest we merge for4.18, and keep the cc: stable so it can be
backported to the stable trees.

Cheers,

Joel
