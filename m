If you do this it probably makes sense to fix a few other drivers
Kconfig in the process. It's not just a problem with your driver.
"my" drivers:

drivers/gpu/drm/mcde/Kconfig
drivers/gpu/drm/pl111/Kconfig
drivers/gpu/drm/tve200/Kconfig

certainly needs this as well, and pretty much anything that is
selecting DRM_KMS_CMA_HELPER or
DRM_GEM_CMA_HELPER "wants" DMA_CMA.
