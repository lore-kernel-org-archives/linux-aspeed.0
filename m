There are several options:

- avoid the use of the header and redefine the binding to have a
  clear mapping between hardware clock lines and the numeric
  representation. This works better for some SoCs than others,
  YMMV.
- Don't use the constants in the dts files for now, but use the
  numbers directly, and update the dts files for the next merge window
- merge only one side for 4.16, either the driver or the dts files,
  and follow up with the other one in 4.17
- make one shared git branch that contains only the headers
  and base both the driver and the dts files on that branch so you
  get a single shared commit ID.

I'm fine with any of the above, please pick whatever suits you best.
