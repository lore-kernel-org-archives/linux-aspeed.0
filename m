Dear Andrew & Joel,

Since you are ASPEED BMC experts, any time and interest in eSPI code=20
review ? I've sent

it before, but no more response. Intel recommends eSPI bus than LPC as I=20
know. I just kept

the minimal eSPI code which is approved to work well in our real server=20
boards for two more

years. Other part of eSPI driver from ASPEED's SDK=C2=A0 has been removed, =

because ePSI is a new

thing, we only use a small feature set like booting host.

We Intel submit this eSPI patch for openbmc upstreaming, hope for your=20
response. :-)
