Subject: [PATCH 7/8] ARM: dts: aspeed: Add aliases for UARTs
In-Reply-To: <20170928075149.8154-1-joel@jms.id.au>
References: <20170928075149.8154-1-joel@jms.id.au>

Existing userspace expects the console (UART5) to be at /dev/ttyS4.  To
ensure the UARTs show up where users expect them, we give them fixed
aliases starting at 0.
