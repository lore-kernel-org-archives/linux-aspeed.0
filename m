Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] i2c: make use of i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg

Hi!

The nice little inline i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg is not getting
enough use. This series improves the situation and drops a
bunch of lines in the process.

I have only compile-tested (that part fine, at least over here).

Changes since v1     https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/5/14/919

- Squashed patches 1-3 (algos) and patches 4-21 (busses) making
  the series consist of just two patches instead of 21.
- Added ack-bys and reviewed-bys from Guenter, Uwe and LinusW.
- Eliminated the flags variable in algos/i2c-algo-pcf.c

Cheers,
Peter
