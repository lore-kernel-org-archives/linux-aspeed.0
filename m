This patch is in the continuation to the discussions which happened on
'commit f89504300e94 ("spi: Stacked/parallel memories bindings")' for
adding dt-binding support for stacked/parallel memories.

This patch series updated the spi-nor, spi core and the spi drivers
to add stacked and parallel memories support.
---
BRANCH: mtd/next

Changes in v2:
- Rebased the patches on top of v6.2-rc1 
- Created separate patch to add get & set APIs for spi->chip_select & 
  spi->cs_gpiod, and replaced all spi->chip_select and spi->cs_gpiod 
  references with the API calls.
- Created separate patch to add get & set APIs for nor->params.
