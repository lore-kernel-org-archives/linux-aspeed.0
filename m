This commit adds 'bus-timeout-ms' property as an optional property
which can be used for setting the bus timeout value of an adapter.
With this patch, the bus timeout value can be set through this
property at the probing time of this module. Still the bus timeout
value can be set by an I2C_TIMEOUT ioctl on cdev at runtime too.
