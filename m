Initially we wanted to have  a single driver,
however we had an informal discussion with one of the maintainer 
and based on the feedback, followed the Linux DMA and UART architecture.

If this seperate DMA-engine driver adds more overhead than benifit,
we will merge them into a single UART driver and resubmitt the patches.
Vinod,
      can this dma-controller driver sit under dma subsystem?.
      or better to move it under UART framework.

Thank you.
