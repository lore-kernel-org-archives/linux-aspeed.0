It can be controlled using an ioctl command on an I2C cdev from
userspace if CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV is enabled. A couple of I2C drivers use
their own specific default value for it but in general the common
default value (1 second) which is set by i2c core is sufficient.
But it still needs to be tuned for specific cases based on attached
devices' characteristic, on packet length, on bus speed and on etc.
Specifically in Aspeed I2C driver for BMC, it should be tuned
to support multi-master use cases properly, and it needs a device tree
property to apply this timeout value from the probing time of the
module.

Okay, I'll change it to 'timeout'.

Thanks a lot,
