Subject: [PATCH v4 0/6] Add Aspeed G7 gpio support

The Aspeed 7th generation SoC features two GPIO controllers: one with 12
GPIO pins and another with 216 GPIO pins. The main difference from the
previous generation is that the control logic has been updated to support
per-pin control, allowing each pin to have its own 32-bit register for
configuring value, direction, interrupt type, and more.
This patch serial also add low-level operations (llops) to abstract the
register access for GPIO registers and the coprocessor request/release in
gpio-aspeed.c making it easier to extend the driver to support different
hardware register layouts.

Change since v3:
- Add `privilege_ctrl` and `privilege_init` callback
- Use `bool aspeed_gpio_support_copro()` api to replace the
`cmd_source_supoort` flag
- Add the `dcache_require` flag and move the dcache usage into the
reg_bit_set callback
- `reg_bits_set` -> `reg_bit_set` and `reg_bits_read` -> `reg_bits_get`
- `bool copro = 0` -> `bool copro = false`
- `if (!gpio->config->llops->reg_bit_set || 
!gpio->config->llops->reg_bits_get) return -EINVAL;`
- Correct the access of reg_irq_status
- Remove __init attribute to fix the compiler warning

Change since v2:
- Correct minItems for gpio-line names
- Remove the example for ast2700, because it?s the same as the AST2600
- Fix the sparse warning which is reported by the test robot
- Remove the version and use the match data to replace it.
- Add another two patches one for deferred probe one for flush write.

Changes since v1:
- Merge the gpio-aspeed-g7.c into the gpio-aspeed.c.
- Create the llops in gpio-aspeed.c for flexibility.

Billy Tsai (6):
  dt-bindings: gpio: aspeed,ast2400-gpio: Support ast2700
  gpio: aspeed: Remove the name for bank array
  gpio: aspeed: Create llops to handle hardware access
  gpio: aspeed: Support G7 Aspeed gpio controller
  gpio: aspeed: Change the macro to support deferred probe
  gpio: aspeed: Add the flush write to ensure the write complete.
