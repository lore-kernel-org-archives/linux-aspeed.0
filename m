why is this in serial. It is dmaengine driver so belongs to drivers/dma/
like other controllers. Please move it out and resubmit.

While doing resubmission please take some time to understand subsystem
tags to use. (hint git log <subsystem> will tell you)

Also series has [[PATCH] 8/9] whereas it should be [PATCH 8/9] please
let git generate that for you (hint git format-patch start..end does a
good job)

we dont use this log in kernel. I do not see s-o-b by Shivah, that
should be added. I think he should be author and you need to list
changes you did..
