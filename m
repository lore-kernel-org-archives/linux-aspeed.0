Subject: [PATCH v4 0/2] gpio: Generalise state persistence

Hello,

This series provides an API to configure general GPIO state persistence in
gpiolib. Previously, only sleep persistence was considered, but controllers
like one found in Aspeed BMCs also support persistence of state across
controller resets. There is some prior discussion on v1[1] and the initial
RFC[2], and minor comments on v2[3]. v3 addresses minor issues with comments
and debug statements[4], removing remaining references to reset tolerance.

v4 is just a rebase of v3 onto v4.15-rc1, fixing a conflict with the new
PIN_CONFIG_SKEW_DELAY pinconf parameter.

Please review!

Andrew
