I kept them separate since it's a slightly different case.
Using 'ptr' instead of '&ptr->other_member'. Regardless, I'll split
this commit up as you mentioned.

To clarify I understand you correctly:
I should do one patch set per-subsystem with every instance/(file?)
fixed as a separate commit?

If I understand correctly, I'll repost accordingly.
