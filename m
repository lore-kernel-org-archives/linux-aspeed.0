This series adds support for the i2c buses and vuart in the ASPEED device
trees, as well as making a few cleanups.

v2 fixes issues pointed out by Andrew's reivew, and adds Brendan's acks. Thanks
for the review both of you!

There's one more patch than v1 to seperate out fixing the UARTs from changing
their oder. I also used --diff-algorithm=patience for a nicer diff in patch 1.

I will merge these into my Aspeed devicetree tree once they have some acks.

I have a second series ready to go as soon as our clk driver is merged.

Cheers,

Joel
