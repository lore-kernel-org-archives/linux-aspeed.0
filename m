Perhaps the inline should test for I2C_M_REV_DIR_ADDR
as there is at least one use like

-               addr = msg->addr << 1;
-               if (flags & I2C_M_RD)
-                       addr |= 1;
+               addr = i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg(msg);
                if (flags & I2C_M_REV_DIR_ADDR)
                        addr ^= 1;

which look odd

Do any of these changes now no longer need
the temporary flags variable?
