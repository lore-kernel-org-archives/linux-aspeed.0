Subject: [PATCH v4 13/16] dt-bindings: ipmi: Add optional SerIRQ property to
 ASPEED KCS devices

Allocating IO and IRQ resources to LPC devices is in-theory an operation
for the host, however ASPEED don't appear to expose this capability
outside the BMC (e.g. SuperIO). Instead, we are left with BMC-internal
registers for managing these resources, so introduce a devicetree
property for KCS devices to describe SerIRQ properties.
