AST2600 has 2 SGPIO master interfaces one with 128 pins and another one
has 80 pins, it also supports 2 SGPIO slave interfaces.
However, there is only the first sgpio master/slave interface defined in
dtsi and pinctrl driver.
The patch series adds the second SGPIO master and slave interfaces
in dt-bindings, dtsi and pinctrl driver.

Please help to review.

Thanks,
Steven
