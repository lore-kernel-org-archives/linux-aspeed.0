This commit adds 'timeout-ms' and '#retries' properties as common
optional properties that can be used for setting 'timeout' and
'retries' values of 'struct i2c_adapter'. With this patch, the bus
timeout value and the master transfer retries count can be set
through these DT properties at the registration time of an adapter.
Still the values can be set by I2C_TIMEOUT and I2C_RETRIES ioctls
on cdev at runtime too.

These properties may not be supported by all drivers. However, if
a driver wants to support one of them, it should adapt the
bindings in this document.

 Binding may contain optional "interrupts" property, describing interrupts
 used by the device. I2C core will assign "irq" interrupt (or the very first
 interrupt if not using interrupt names) as primary interrupt for the slave.
