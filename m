Subject: [PATCH for v5.9] dt-bindings: aspeed-lpc: Replace HTTP links with
 HTTPS ones
Message-ID: <20200719173447.60603-1-grandmaster@al2klimov.de>
List-Id: <linux-aspeed.lists.ozlabs.org>
To: linux-aspeed@lists.ozlabs.org
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Rationale:
Reduces attack surface on kernel devs opening the links for MITM
as HTTPS traffic is much harder to manipulate.

Deterministic algorithm:
For each file:
  If not .svg:
    For each line:
      If doesn't contain `\bxmlns\b`:
        For each link, `\bhttp://[^# \t\r\n]*(?:\w|/)`:
	  If neither `\bgnu\.org/license`, nor `\bmozilla\.org/MPL\b`:
            If both the HTTP and HTTPS versions
            return 200 OK and serve the same content:
              Replace HTTP with HTTPS.

 (Actually letting a shell for loop submit all this stuff for me.)

 If there are any URLs to be removed completely
 or at least not (just) HTTPSified:
 Just clearly say so and I'll *undo my change*.

 If there are any valid, but yet not changed URLs:

 If you apply the patch, please let me know.

 Sorry again to all maintainers who complained about subject lines.
 Now I realized that you want an actually perfect prefixes,
 not just subsystem ones.
 I tried my best...
 And yes, *I could* (at least half-)automate it.
 Impossible is nothing! :)
