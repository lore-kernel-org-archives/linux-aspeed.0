Hi,

Well I'm not sure it would simplify the read interface; it's quite 
simple as it is, both in the driver and to set up in user-space.

I did get streaming I/O working but found the performance significantly 
worse than simple read calls, and therefore not worth the additional 
complexity.

Is it required that I support streaming?

Thanks,
Eddie
