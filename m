StorLink was the initial company, thus SL3516, SL3512
the name of the chips.

Then that company changed name to Storm Semiconductor.

Git acquired by Cortina.

Then Inphi acquired Cortina.

Then Marvell scooped up the IP.

If we *have* to use a company name I would use storlink,
because the chips are named after that.
