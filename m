Arnd, Michael, Stephen; how do we resolve this? We need the
dt-bindings header to be present for both the clk driver and the
device tree to build.

The clk driver is not (yet - soon I hope?) merged by Michael and
Stephen. I am about to commit the device tree changes that will go
through the ARM SoC tree.

Cheers,

Joel
