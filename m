Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: aspeed: Fix hwrng register address

The register address should be the full address of the rng, not the
offset from the start of the SCU.

Hi ARM maintainers, this was found when testing next-20180529 after the
merge of the aspeed 4.18 pull request.  Can you please apply this one to
your -next tree?

I'll also send a PR with some defconfig updates so the rng driver is
enabled by default.
