Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: Update ASPEED entry with details
Message-ID: <20180222050324.21531-1-joel@jms.id.au>

I am interested in all ASPEED drivers, and the previous match wasn't
grabbing files in nested directories. Use N instead.

Add the arm kernel mailing list so that patches get reviewed there, and
the linux-aspeed list which exists only so I can use patchwork to track
patches.

Add Andrew as a reviewer, because he is involved in reviewing ASPEED
stuff.
