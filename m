I say no, because the driver has to also indicate support with
I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING and I don't see a sane way to check
that part of the contract. But what do I know. Seems orthogonal.

Right, I thought I had made any obvious further simplification made
possible by these changes, but I overlooked that one. The flags
variable is certainly over-engineered in i2c-algo-pcf.c and would
be a good candidate for removal. But that's only patch 3/21.

I'll wait for a bit with an update, and Wolfram can adjust this on
the way in if he feels like it.

Cheers,
Peter
