I, as a printk maintainer, am not completely familiar with all
the console driver problems. But we, printk maintainers, come
to similar deadlocks from the printk side, so we are definitely
interested into this kind of patches.

BTW: There was an attempt to avoid the console_unlock() related
deadlocks a more generic way, see
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181016050428.17966-1-sergey.senozhatsky at gmail.com
Unfortunately, there is some push back against introducing a new
printk-related-locking API.

I have glanced over the patches via
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-arm-msm/msg44083.html
I still have to think about it. I will be traveling next week
so it might take some time.

Anyway, please CC printk people into v2 if any.

Best Reagards,
Petr
