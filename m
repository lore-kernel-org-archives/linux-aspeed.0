We could do this, and I generally follow the practice of adding Fixes
tags. I hadn't because without an upstream clock driver, the Aspeed
port is not usable by anyone without making modifications. We're
really depending on getting that code merged.

I will send it as a fix to 4.15. Do you mind taking individual patches
for the arm dt tree, or would you prefer a pull request?

Cheers,

Joel
